# About me

I am an aspiring Data Analyst, determined to build my career in this fascinating and challenging field. My journey began as a teacher, where I acquired strong skills in communication, organization, and the ability to translate complex concepts into simple and accessible ideas – a quality I believe is essential for a data analyst. Later, I worked as a Web Designer, where I developed technical and creative skills by planning and implementing visual and functional solutions.

During my undergraduate studies, I developed a deep interest in Data Analytics, especially in subjects related to data analysis, modeling, and visualization, in which I achieved outstanding academic performance. These results not only reinforced my technical aptitude but also fueled my desire to transform data into actionable insights that can guide strategic decisions.

I am committed to applying my knowledge in tools such as Excel, SQL, and Power BI, as well as my analytical skills, to solve real-world problems and add value to organizations. My transition to the field of data analytics represents more than just a career change – it is a step toward what truly inspires me: uncovering patterns, telling stories through data, and driving innovation.
